title: Lightheartedness
---

I was feeling quite heavy yesterday - to the point of being depressed - probably caused by multiple reasons: slog at work where progress is slower to come by, risk of not _performing well_, the cold weather and physically not feeling the best. I ended the night reading a newspaper article by Tom Robbins [In Defiance of Gravity](https://alina_stefanescu.typepad.com/files/in-defiance-of-gravity-by-tom-robbins.pdf). He talked about standing on a bridge in Washington -  ready to end his life - till he remembered something whimsical and unexpected uttered by one of his old colleagues at a club in New York. The memory of that whimsical act that flaunted rules, norms and expectations brought him back from the brink of ending his life. It's a beautiful article and you should read and enjoy it. The article left me feeling _lighter_ - something I needed last night.

Tom's message appeared to carry deep wisdom. He talked about _lightheartedness_ and _serious play_ and _crazy wisdom_. He contrasted _lightheartedness_ with _lightweight_ - just because something is lighthearted does not mean it is lightweight. Just because it's _play_ does not mean it is not _serious_ and _gravely consequential_. I feel the most _alive_ when I'm lighthearted. I'm the most creative when I'm feeling playful - the world is full of possibilities in those moments. My ego also feels diminished in those moments. In contrast my self-preservation and self is more front and center when I'm feeling heavy - usually feeling miserable and lamenting how hard life is.

_Grave consequence_ and _play_ don't exactly go well together. The stakes are high when something is consequential - high stakes aren't known for triggering a playful response. You _care_ a lot about something if it's consequential; it makes you you _tense up_ - physically as well as emotionally. That can help with intense focus. It can also lead to paralysis. Regardless I don't recall ever being creative when tensed up - playfulness involves _not caring_ about outcomes to a degree.

> As an interesting aside: it's hard not to be reminded of my experience when swimming. Staying afloat and swimming requires your body to be _light_ and for you to _let go_ and the consequences can be grave if you don't and my natural reaction is generally to tense up and I struggle _letting it go_.

Another pattern I've seen is that of playfulness, curiosity and unbounded potential on day zero but gradual paralysis as the days go by and more effort is put on the project. The more I walk on a journey the more I learn about the problem and a sense of _playfulness_ is helpful - if not critical - for working through roadblocks and making progress. Continued effort on a project - one whose outcome is consequential - can lead to a sense of paralysis and stagnation and that's the opposite of what is often needed.

I don't expect to come up with a solution to this gravely consequential delimma but I'll attempt to take a lighthearted approach analyze the issue playfully.

What are some of the _fears_ around adopting a _playful_ attitude?

One fear that comes to mind is not taking the issue _seriously enough_. If we aren't completely and intensely focused on the issue then we might not give it our all and _take it lightly_ when the situation demands anything but. This is a legitimate fear - we do not want to take our _eyes off the ball_. A _playful_ attitude does not have to imply a _careless_ attitude. We do care a lot about a task when we are deeply and playfully engaged in it.

Another fear - somewhat related to the one above - is to keep around playing around without a sense of urgency and direction towards some goal (either the end goal or a milestone). This cuts two ways: not only as a fear but also an impediment. We're often in an exploratory mode when playing and a sense of direction can be at odds with exploration; a sense of urgency and a clicking tock can also be an impediment to playfulness. Exploration can be directional and it's generally helpful to keep it bounded so you can learn and iterate.

If some of the fears are unfounded, misguided or greatly exaggerated then what are some impediments to adopting a playful attitude towards gravely consequential situations?

If the stakes are high it is difficult to _loosen up_ - there's too much at stake and _fear_ of losing kicks in. Not only is it difficult to perform your best when operating from a place of fear but fear can degrade performance to the point of paralysis. I wouldn't go so far to say that you should operate from a place of _courage_ but at least from a place of _hope_. It sounds like a rational move to make.

> This poem has always spoken to me and this line in particular:
> [_"If hopes were dupes, fears may be liars;"_](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43959/say-not-the-struggle-nought-availeth).

_Lightheartedness_ relieves some of the burden off your shoulders. It does not lessen the gravity of the situation - the situation remains just as high stakes before; it changes your perspective so you don't get paralyzed and buried by the burden, recognize the inherent hope along with the risk in any situation and make the rational move to _lighten up_ so you can stay afloat and swim on.
